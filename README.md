# Reflect

Connects to an SQL database and uses it to create a REST API with Authentication middleware and hooks for transforming data.

## TODO:

* Build out default authentication system that uses sqlite or remote database.
* Safely support stored procedures
* Test with PostgreSQL, MsSQL, etc. (only tested with MySQL at the moment)
* Implement nested relationships in JSON output based on foreign key constraints.
